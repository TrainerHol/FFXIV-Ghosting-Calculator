# FFXIV-Ghosting-Calculator
Calculates coordinates along the surface within a 50-yalm radius sphere for the ghosting technique/glitch in FFXIV jump puzzles.
## Steps
Drag the sphere to your desired position or enter a coordinate and click validate to snap to the closest point on the surface to that position.
Enter the whole digit in BDTH. Rounding will give invalid coordinates/distances. The UI on BDTH will round the number but the value will be set.
